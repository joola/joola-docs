Joola is currently running beta mode. This means that we believe it is ready for public use ...but... may still contain some (hopefully minor) bugs. We believe getting Joola into the developers' hands sooner means they can tell us when we're doing right and should changed to be better! This process -- known as "release early, release often" -- is part of our agile development approach.

Once Joola has had several iterations (updates) of beta release, we'll consider it finished, snip the beta ribbon from it and smash a bottle of champagne against it.

We would love to hear [your feedback](https://joo.la/contact)!
